# Software Analysis and Design

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

Architecture is mainly concerned about three things:

- Function
- Separation of Components
- Data Management

# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are ways of programming. A paradigm tells you which programming structures to use, and when to use them. Each paradigm removes capabilities from the programmer. They tell us what *not* to do.

## Structured Programming

Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control. Removes `goto` statements.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control. Removes function pointers.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment. Removes assignment.
