# Software Analysis and Design

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

Architecture is mainly concerned about three things:

- Function
- Separation of Components
- Data Management

# 1. Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are ways of programming. 
A paradigm tells you which programming structures to use, and when to use them. Each paradigm removes capabilities from
the programmer. They tell us what *not* to do.

> TODO: what about declarative programming?

## 1.1. Structured Programming

Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer 
of control. Removes `goto` statements.

Structured programming relies on the BÃ¶hm-Jacopini theorem, which states that all programs can be constructed from just 
three structures:

- **Sequence**: execute one subprogram, then another one.
- **Selection**: execute subprograms according to the value of a boolean expression.
- **Iteration**: execute a subprogram as long as a boolean expression is true.

Structured programming allows modules to be recursively decomposed into provable functions. That is, start with a large-scale problem statement and decompose it into high-level functions which can then be decomposed into lower-level functions.


## 1.2. Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control. Removes function pointers.

Object-oriented programming relies on three concepts: *encapsulation*, *inheritance* and *polymorphism*.

### 1.2.1. Encapsulation

The idea is to draw a line around a cohesive set of data and functions. From outside that line, the data is hidden and only some of the functions are known. This is implemented via public, protected and private members of the class.

### 1.2.2. Inheritance

Inheritance is the mechanism of basing a class upon another class, retaining similar implementation and forming a hierarchy of classes. The child class acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent class.

### 1.2.3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.

> TODO: composition, delegation and open recursion

## 1.3. Functional Programming

Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment. Removes assignment.

Functional programming relies on two concepts:

* **Idempotence**: operations can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
* **Immutability**: variables do not change, there is no state.

One of the most appealing properties of functional programming is that all race conditions, deadlocks, and concurrent update problems are due to mutable variables. If there are no mutable variables, there are no such problems.

# 2. Design Principles: SOLID

The SOLID principles tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected.

These principles allow us to create mid-level software structures that *tolerate change*, are *easy to understand* and are the *basis of components* that can be used in many software systems.

## 2.1. S: Single-Reponsibility Principle (SRP)

Every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.

**Symptoms of Violation**

- **Accidental Duplication**: when different actors use the same functionality.
- **Merge Conflicts**: when different features touch the same code and cause conflicts.

## 2.2. O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The behavior of a software artifact should be extendible, without having to modify the artifact.

This principle is one of the driving forces behind the architecture of systems. The goal is to make the system easy to extend without incurring a high impact of change. This is accomplished by partitioning the system into components, and arranging those components into a dependency hierarchy that protects higher-level components from changes in lower-level components.

## 2.3. L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

This principle states that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

<img src='imgs/lsp.png'>

To accomplish this, several rules must be followed:

- **Contravariant inputs parameters in subclass**: input parameters of each method in subtype $S$ must be the same or a *supertype* of the corresponding parameter of the corresponding method in supertype $T$.
- **Covariant outputs in subclass**: outputs of each method in subtype $S$ must be the same or a *subtype* of the corresponding output of the corresponding method in supertype $T$.
- **Covariant exceptions in subclass**: new exceptions cannot be thrown by the methods in the subtype, except if they are the same or a *subtype* of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.
- **Weaker preconditions in subclass**: preconditions (validation on parameters) cannot be made more strict in the subtype.
- **Stronger postconditions in subclass**: postconditions (validation after method execution) cannot be made less strict in the subtype.

The LSP should be extended to the level of architecture. A simple violation of substitutability can cause a system's architecture to be polluted with a significant amount of extra mechanisms.

## 2.4. I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP dictates that depending on something that carries baggage that you don't need can cause troubles that you didn't expect.

To solve this, you should implement interfaces that contain only the functionality needed by the component.

<img src='imgs/isp.png'>

## 2.5. D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP tells us that the most flexible systems are those in which source code dependencies refer only to abstractions (interfaces, abstract classes or some other kind of abstract declaration), not to concretions (artifacts in which the functions being called are implemented).

The logic is that changes to concretions rarely require changes to the interfaces they implement, therefore interfaces are less volatile than implementations.

To accomplish this, a few rules must be followed:

- **Don't refer to volatile concrete classes**: refer to abstract interfaces instead. This puts severe constraints on the creation of objects and generally enforces the use of *Abstract Factories*. This implies that you shouldn't derive from volatile concrete classes.
- **Don't override concrete functions**: concrete functions often require source code dependencies. When you override those functions you do not eliminate those dependencies, instead you inherit them. To manage those dependencies, you should make the function abstract and create multiple implementations.

<img src='imgs/dip.png'>

The curved line separates the abstract from the concrete. All source code dependencies cross that curved line pointing in the same direction, toward the abstract side.

The abstract component contains all the high-level business rules of the application. The concrete component contains all the implementation details that those business rules manipulate.

Note that the flow of control crosses the curved line in the opposite direction of the source code dependencies (`Application` depends on `ServiceFactory`, but `ServiceFactoryImpl` depends on `ServiceFactory`). The source code dependencies are inverted against the flow of control, which is why we refer to this principle as Dependency Inversion.

# 3. Component Principles

If the SOLID principles tell us how to arrange the bricks into walls and rooms, then the component principles tell us how to arrange the rooms into buildings. Large software systems are built out of smaller components.

Components are the units of deployment. They are the smallest entities that can be deployed as part of a system. Well-designed components always retain the ability to be independently deployable and, therefore, independently developable.

The component structure cannot be designed from the top-down. It is not one of the first things about the system that is designed (because there is no code to start out with), but rather evolves as the system grows and changes.

Component dependency diagrams have very little to do with describing the function of the application. Instead, they are a map to the *buildability* and *maintainability* of the application. The component dependency graph is created and molded by architects to protect stable high-value components from volatile components.

## 3.1. Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle (REP)

Classes and modules that are formed into a component must belong to a cohesive group. There must be some overarching theme or purpose that those classes and modules all share.

Another way to look at this is that classes and modules that are grouped together in a component should be releasable together.

## 3.2. Common Closure Principle (CCP)

This is the SRP restated for components. Just as the SRP says that a class should not contain multiple reasons to change, the CCP says that a component should not have multiple reasons to change.

The CCP prompts us to gather together in one place all the classes that are likely to change for the same reasons. Thus, when a change in requirements comes along, that change has a good change of being restricted to a minimal number of components.

SRP and CCP can be summarized by:
> Gather together those things that change at the same times and for the same reasons. Separate those things that change at different times or for different reasons.

## 3.3. Common Reuse Principle (CRP)

Classes and modules that tend to be reused together belong in the same component. In such components we would expect to see classes that have lots of dependencies on each other.

The CRP also tells us which classes *not* to keep together in a component. When one component uses another, a dependency is created between the components, even if the *using* component uses only one class within the *used* component. Because of this dependency, changes in the *used* component require changes in the *using* component, along with recompilation, revalidation and redeployment.

Thus, when we depend on a component, we want to make sure we depend on every class in that component. Put another way, we want to make sure that the classes that we put into a component are inseparable - that it is impossible to depend on some and not on the others. Classes that are not tightly bound to each other should not be in the same component.

The CRP is the generic version of the ISP. The ISP advises us not to depend on classes that have methods we don't use. The CRP advises us not to depend on components that have classes we don't use.

ISP and CRP can be summarized by:
> Don't depend on things you don't need.

## 3.4. The Tension Diagram for Component Cohesion

The three cohesion principles tend to fight each other. REP and CCP tend to make components larger, while CRP tends to make components smaller.

The tension diagram below shows the interaction between the cohesion principles. The edges of the diagram describe the cost of abandoning the principle on the opposite vertex.

<img src='imgs/cohesion-tension.png'>

## 3.5. Acyclic Dependencies Principle (ADP)

Ideally, a dependency graph should be fully directed, with no cycles, as shown below:

<img src='imgs/adp-dag.png'>

However, in some cases, you could end up with something like this:

<img src='imgs/adp-dcg.png'>

This causes coupling and problems in testing, development and deployment.

It is always possible to break a cycle of components and reinstate the dependency graph as a DAG. There are two primary mechanisms for doing so:

1. Apply the Dependency Inversion Principle by creating an interface.

<img src='imgs/adp-1.png'>

2. Create a new component that both `Entities` and `Authorizer` depend on. Move the classes that they both depend on into that new component.

<img src='imgs/adp-2.png'>

## 3.6. Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP)

This principle states that you should depend in the direction of stability. That is, a given component should depend only on more stable packages.

By conforming to the CCP, we create components that are sensitive to certain kinds of changes but immune to others. Some of these components are *designed* to be volatile. We expect them to change.

A component that is difficult to change should not depend on a component we expect to be volatile. Otherwise, the volatile component will also be difficult to change.

Stability does not refer to the frequency of change, but instead refers to the amount of work required to make a change. This amount of work is directly related to the amount of components that depend on it. A component with lots of incoming dependencies is very stable because it requires a great deal of work to reconcile any changes with all the dependent components.

<img src='imgs/sdp-stable.png'>

X is stable, since three components depend on it, so it has three good reasons not to change. Conversely, X depends on nothing, so it has no external influence to make it change. We say it is *independent*.

<img src='imgs/sdp-unstable.png'>

Y is unstable, since no other components depend on it. Also, it has three components that it depends on, so changes may come from three external sources. We say that Y is *dependent*.

### 3.6.1. Stability Metrics

One way to measure the stability of a component is to count the number of dependencies that enter and leave that component.

$$I=\frac{\phi_{\text{out}}}{\phi_{\text{in}}+\phi_{\text{out}}}$$

- $I \in [0, 1]$: instability
- $\phi_{\text{in}}$: number of classes outside this component that depend on classes within the component.
- $\phi_{\text{out}}$: number of classes inside this component that depend on classes outside the component.

The SDP says that the $I$ metric of a component should be larger than the $I$ metrics of the components that it depends on. That is, $I$ metrics should *decrease* in the direction of dependency.

Putting the unstable components at the top of the diagram is a useful convention because any arrow that points *up* is violating the SDP.

To fix SDP violations, we can employ the DIP by creating an interface.

<img src='imgs/sdp-violation.png'>

<img src='imgs/sdp-solution.png'>

## 3.7. Stable Abstractions Principle (SAP)

This principle states that a component should be as abstract as it is stable.

- Software that encapsulates the high-level business logic and policies of the system should be placed into stable components.
- Software that we want to be able to quickly and easily change should be placed into unstable components.

The SAP sets up a relationship between stability and abstractness. It says that a stable component should also be abstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended, and that an unstable component should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed.

### 3.7.1. Measuring Abstraction

$$A=\frac{N_a}{N_c}$$

- $A$: abstractness
- $N_a$: number of abstract classes and interfaces in the component
- $N_c$: number of classes in the component.

Then we can plot $I$ vs $A$:

<img src='imgs/main-seq.png'>

This plot helps determine the zones of exclusion.

- **Zone of pain**: highly stable and concrete component. Undesirable because it is rigid. Cannot be extended because it is not abstract, and is very difficult to change because of its stability. Note that this only applies to volatile components. A nonvolatile component in this region is not really painful at all.
- **Zone of uselessness**: highly abstract, but no dependents. Such components are useless. They are often leftover abstract classes that no one ever implemented.

The most desirable position for a component is at one of the two endpoints of the Main Sequence.

### 3.7.2. Measuring Distance from the Main Sequence

$$D=|A+I-1|$$

Given this metric, a design can be analyzed for its overall conformance to the Main Sequence. Any component that has a $D$ value that is not near zero can be reexamined and restructured.

Statistical analysis can be conducted on this metric too, calculating the mean and variance of $D$ for the components within a design. We would expect a conforming design to have a mean and variance that are close to zero.

Another way to use the metrics is to plot the $D$ metric of each component over time, helping us identify components that are drifting from the Main Sequence.

# 4. Architecture Design: Independence

Software Architecture deals with the division of systems into components, the arrangement of those components, and the ways in which those components communicate with each other. The purpose of this is to facilitate the development, deployment, operation and maintenance of the system.

Good architectures leave as many options open as possible, for as long as possible. In other words, a good architect maximizes the number of decisions *not* made.

Architectures should not be about frameworks. Good architectures are centered on use cases so that architects can safely describe the structures that support those use cases without committing to frameworks, tools or environments. **If your system architecture is all about the use cases, and if you have kept your frameworks at arm's length, then you should be able to unit-test all those use cases without any of the frameworks in place.**

All software systems can be decomposed into two major elements: *policy* and *details*. The *policy* embodies all the business rules and procedures, it is where the true value of the system lives. Details are those things that are necessary to enable humans, other systems and programmers to communicate with the policy, but that do not impact the behavior of the policy at all. This includes IO devices, databases, web systems, servers, frameworks, communication protocols and so forth.

The goal of the architect is to create an architecture that recognized policy as the most essential element of the system while making the details irrelevant to that policy. This allows decisions about those details to be *delayed* and *deferred*. For example:

- **Databases**: the high-level policy doesn't care about the type of database used.
- **Web servers**: the high-level policy doesn't know that it is being delivered over the web.
- **External interfaces**: the high-level policy should be agnostic about the interface to the outside world.
- **Dependency injection**: the high-level policy should not care about how dependencies are resolved.

> If you can develop the high-level policy without committing to the details that surround it, you can delay and defer decisions about those details for a long time. And the longer you wait to make those decisions, the more information you have with which to make them properly. This also enables experimentation. If the policy is database agnostic, you could try connecting it to several different databases to check applicability and performance.

A good architecture must support:

- **The use cases of the system**: this is the first priority of the architecture. The intent of the system should be evident at the architectural level.
- **The operational requirements of the system**: the architecture must support the kind of throughput and response time required. Proper isolation of components that doesn't assume the means of communication between the components can be easily transitioned into microservices, multithreads, distributed computing or whatever is needed.
- **The development of the system**: properly partitioning the system into well-isolated, independently developable components.
- **The deployment of the system**: proper partitioning and isolation of components enable the system to be immediately deployable after build.

The main idea is to leave options open. We don't know all the use cases and requirements a-priori, and our system should minimize the effort of implementing new ones.

The golden rule is to decouple components that change for different reasons.

If you decouple the elements of the system that change for different reasons, then you can continue to add new use cases without interfering with old ones. If you also group the UI and database in support of those use cases, so that each use case uses a different aspect of the UI and database, then adding new use cases will be unlikely to affect older ones.

## 4.1. Decoupling Layers

Employ the Single Responsibility Principle and Common Closure Principle to separate those things that change for the same reasons - given the context of the intent of the system.

We can then divide the system into decoupled horizontal layers:

- UI, e.g: mobile view, web view.
- Application-specific business rules, e.g: validation rules.
- Application-independent business rules, e.g: calculation of interest on an account.
- Database, e.g: relational, non-relational.

## 4.2. Decoupling Use Cases

Use cases are a very natural way to divide the system. The use case for adding an order to an order entry system will change for different reasons than the use case that deletes an order from the system.

We can then divide the system into decoupled vertical layers that each use some components in the horizontal layers.

To achieve this decoupling we separate the UI of the add-order use case from the UI of the delete-order use case. We do the same with the business rules, and with the database.

## 4.3. Decoupling Modes

This deals with the operation level. If the UI and the database have been separated from the business rules, then they can run in different servers. 

However, to take advantage of the operational benefit, the decoupling must have the appropriate mode. To run in separate servers, the separated components cannot depend on being together in the same address space of a processor. They must be independent services, which communicate over a network of some kind. This results in a microservice architecture.

There are multiple ways to decouple layers and use cases:

- **Source-level decoupling mode**: control the dependencies between source code modules so that changes to one module do not force changes of others. Components execute in the same address space, and communicate with each other using simple function calls. This is often called a monolithic structure.
- **Deployment-level decoupling mode**: control the dependencies between deployable units such as jar files, DLLs, or shared libraries, so that changes to the source code in one module do not force others to be rebuilt and redeployed.
- **Service-level decoupling mode**: we can reduce the dependencies down to the level of data structures, and communicate solely through network packets such that every execution unit is entirely independent of source and binary change to others.

# 5. Architecture Design: Boundaries

Software architecture is the art of drawing boundaries. Those boundaries separate software elements from one another, and restrict those on one side from knowing about those on the other.

The SRP tells us where to draw our boundaries. You draw boundaries between things that matter and things that don't. The GUI doesn't matter to the business rules, so there should be a boundary between then. The database doesn't matter to the business rules, so there should be a boundary between them.

All the business rules need to know is that there is a set of functions that can be used to fetch or save data. This allows us to put the database behind an interface. As shown below, the `BusinessRules` use the `DatabaseInterface` to load and save data. The `DatabaseAccess` implements the interface and directs the operation of the actual `Database`.

<img src='imgs/db-interface.png'>

Note the two arrows leaving the `DatabaseAccess` class. Those two arrows point away from the `DatabaseAccess` class. That means that none of these classes knows that the `DatabaseAccess` class exists.

These boundaries are drawn because we want certain modules to be immune to others. For example, we don't want the business rules to break when someone changes the schema of the database.

To draw boundary lines, you first partition the system into components. Some of these components are the core business rules; others are plugins that contain the necessary functions that are not related to the core business. Then you arrange the code in those components such that the arrows between them point in one direction - toward the core business.

This is an application of the Dependency Inversion Principle and the Stable Abstractions Principle. Dependency arrows are arranged to point from lower-level details to higher-level abstractions.

## 5.1. Boundary Crossing

A boundary crossing is a function on one side of the boundary calling a function on the other side and passing along some data. The trick to creating an appropriate boundary crossing is to manage the source code dependencies.

### 5.1.1. Functional Calls

Has no strict physical representation. It is simply a segregation of functions and data within a single processor and a single address space.

High-level clients invoke a lower-level service. Dynamic polymorphism is used to invert the dependency against the flow of control such that the runtime dependency (function calls) opposes the compile-time dependency (dependency flow).

In the image below, the high-level `Client` class calls the `f()` function of the lower-level `ServiceImpl` through the `Service` interface, passing `Data` as a function argument. Note that the definition of the data structure is on the calling side of the boundary.

<img src='imgs/flow-of-control.png'>

### 5.1.2. Local Processes

A stronger physical architectural boundary is the local process. A local process is typically created from the command line or an equivalent system call.

Often, local processes communicate with each other using sockets or some other kind of OS communications facility such as mailboxes or message queues.

Source code of higher-level processes must not contain the names or physical addresses of lower-level processes.

### 5.1.3. Services

Services are the strongest physical boundaries. Services do not depend on their physical location, and communication take place over a network.

Lower-level services should "plug-in" to higher-level services. The source code of higher-level services must not contain any specific physical knowledge (e.g. a URI) of any lower-level service.

# 6. Architecture: Policy and Level

At its core a computer program is a detailed description of the policy by which inputs are transformed into outputs. Policies describe how particular business rules are calculated, how certain reports are formatted and how input data is validated.

Developing a software architecture requires carefully separating those policies and regrouping them based on the ways that they change. Policies that change for the same reasons, and at the same times, are at the same level and belong in the same component.

The art of architecture involves forming the components into a DAG. The nodes are the components that contain policies at the same level. The edges are the dependencies between those components. They connect components that are at different levels.

The *level* of a policy is the distance from the inputs and the outputs. The farther a policy is from both the inputs and the outputs of the system, the higher its level. Policies that manage input and output are the lowest level policies.

Consider a program that reads characters from an input device, translates the characters using a table and then writes the translated characters to an output device.

<img src='imgs/encrypt-program.png'>

The `Translate` component is the highest-level component in this system because it is the component that is farthest away from the inputs and outputs. Note that the data flow and source code dependencies do not always point in the same direction. We want source code dependencies to be **decoupled from the data flow and coupled to level**.

A good architecture for this system is shown below:

<img src='imgs/encrypt-boundary.png'>

The boundary separates two components: `Encryption` and `IODevices`. Note how this structure decouples the high-level encryption policy from the lower-level IO policies. This makes the encryption policy usable in a wide range of contexts. Changes to the IO policies do not affect the encryption policy.

<img src='imgs/encrypt-components.png'>

This architecture makes it so that lower-level components are plugins to the higher-level components. The `Encryption` component knows nothing of the `IODevices` component; the `IODevices` component depends on the `Encryption` component.

# 7. Business Rules

*Business rules* are procedures that make or save the business money. These usually require data to work with; this data is called *business data*.

Business rules and business data are inextricably bound, so we usually group the data and behavior together into an *Entity*.

These entities stand alone as representatives of the business and they don't care about databases, user interfaces or third-party frameworks.

However, not all business rules are as pure as entities. Some rules define or constrain the way that an automated system operates. These rules are *use cases*. Use cases specify the input provided, the output returned and the processing steps involved in producing that output. A use case describes application-specific business rules.

Use cases contain the rules that specify how and when the business rules within the entities are invoked. Use cases are objects that contain the functions that implement the application-specific business rules and the data elements that include the input data, output data, and the references to the appropriate entities with which it interacts.

Entities have no knowledge of the use cases that control them. This is another example of the DSP: high-level entities know nothing of lower-level use cases. Use cases depend on entities, not the other way around.

The use case class accepts simple request data structures for its input, and returns simple response data structures as its output. These data structures are not dependant on anything - they know nothing about HTML, SQL or frameworks.

# 8. The Clean Architecture

Clean architectures should produce systems that have the following characteristics: 

- Independent of frameworks
- Unit-testable without any external element such as UI, database or webserver
- Independent of UI
- Independent of the database technology
- Independent of interfaces to the outside world

<img src='imgs/clean-architecture.png'>

This diagram summarizes the most important ideas in clean architecture:

- Source code dependencies must point only inward, toward higher-level policies. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. This is known as the **dependency rule**.
- Data structures declared in an outer circle should not be used by an inner circle.
- Entities encapsulate enterprise-wide business rules. These could be used by many different applications.
- Use cases encapsulate application-specific business rules.
- Interface adapters convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities to the format most convenient for external agencies such as the database or the web. All the components of a MVC architecture belong here. Models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views.
- Frameworks and drivers generally don't contain much code, other than glue code that communicates with the interface adapters. Here is were all the details (web, database, frameworks) go. We keep them on the outside, where they can do little harm.
- The flow of control begins in the controller, goes to the use case and then executes in the presenter. The source code dependencies flow inward toward the use cases. This apparent contradiction is resolved by using the DIP by arranging interface and inheritance relationships such that the source code dependencies oppose the flow of control at just the right points across the boundary.
- Data that crosses the boundaries consists of simple data structures, basic structs, data transfer objects or function call arguments. We don't want to pass Entity objects or database rows. We don't want the data structures to have any kind of dependency that violates the Dependency Rule.

A typical architecture is shown below:

<img src='imgs/sample-architecture.png'>

Notice the direction of the dependencies. All dependencies cross the boundary lines pointing inward, following the dependency rule.

### Separation of Concerns

First we'll apply the SRP to separate the responsibilities into data calculation and data presentation:

Having made this separation, we need to organize source code dependencies to ensure that changes to one of those responsibilities do not cause changes in the other, and ensure that behavior can be extended without undo modification.

To do this, we partition processes into classes, and group classes into components.

### Directional Control

- I: interfaces
- DS: data structures
- Open arrows are *using* relationships
- Closed arrows are *inheritance* relationships

An arrow pointing from class A to class B means that the source code of class A knows about class B, but class B knows nothing about class A.

Component relationships are unidirectional, these arrows point toward the components that we want to protect from change.

**If component A should be protected from changes in component B, then component B should depend on component A.**

Notice the *Interactor* is protected from everything. This is because this component contains the business rules, the highest-level policies of the application. All other components are dealing with peripheral concerns. 

Even though the *Controller* is peripheral to the *Interactor*, it is nevertheless central to the *Presenters* and *Views*. This creates a hierarchy of protection based on the notion of "level".

This is how the OCP works at the architectural level. Architects separate functionality based on *how*, *why* and *when* it changes, and then organize that separated functionality into a hierarchy of components. Higher-level components are protected from the changes made to lower-level components.

Most of the complexity in the diagram was intended to make sure that the dependencies between the components flow in the correct direction. For example, the `FinancialDataGateway` interface between the `FinancialReportGenerator` and the `FinancialDataMapper` exists to invert the dependency that would otherwise have pointed from the `Interactor` component to the `Database` component.

### Information Hiding

The `FinancialReportRequester` interface exists to protect the `FinancialReportController` from knowing too much about the internals of the `Interactor`. If the interface were not there, then the `Controller` would have transitive dependencies on the `FinancialEntities`.

Transitive dependencies are a violation of the general principle that software entities should not depend on things they don't directly use. So, even though our priority is to protect the `Interactor` from changes to the `Controller`, we also want to protect the `Controller` from changes to the `Interactor` by hiding its internals.
